i want and make a 3d endless runner with neon effects environment help me how to make it

I'll help you create a 3D endless runner with neon effects! Let me first explore the current project structure to understand what we're working with.
I see you have an empty project with just an Asset folder. I'll help you create a 3D endless runner with neon effects using Unity, which is perfect for this type of game. Let me create the necessary files and structure for your project.
Now let me create the core scripts for the 3D endless runner. I'll start with the player controller:
Now let me create the GameManager script to handle the overall game state:
Now let me create the obstacle generator script:
Now let me create a camera follow script for smooth camera movement:
Now let me create a neon material shader script for the visual effects:
Now let me create a UI manager script for the game interface:
Now let me create some prefab scripts for obstacles and collectibles:
Now let me create a collectible script:
Now let me create a setup guide and some additional utility scripts:
Now let me create a comprehensive setup guide:
Finally, let me create a quick start script that will help with the initial setup:
Perfect! I've created a complete 3D endless runner game with neon effects for you. Here's what I've built:
